# fet-timetabling-compute
FET is free software for automatically scheduling the timetable of a school. This repository is used to import the timetable.csv as JSON, to import an Excel that maps the class and the room and to generate an HTML page to search the room of a class in a specified day/hour and to get the html table of all classes and the daily assigned rooms
