# fet-timetabling-compute

[FET - Free Timetabling Software](https://www.lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/) is free software for automatically scheduling the timetable of a school. This repository is used to import the timetable.csv as JSON, to import an Excel that maps the classes and the rooms as JSON, to compute the search of a room of a class in a specified day/hour and to compute the table of all classes with the daily assigned rooms.
